# biLSTM

We implement biLSTM to solve the task as well. This folder stores the corresponding scripts. The folder has the following structure:

* embeddings: We describe which embedding we have used and how to download it.

* scripts: In this folder, we include the codes for training the biLSTM model. Under the assumption that we are considering multi-label text data. 

* trial_folder: Asides from multi-label prediction, we also consider single-label setting. That was the initial trial we conducted using PyTorch. The results were not good, so we did not mention it in the report.
