Here’s the rest of the video.,27
"watching [NAME] attempt hook shots gives me a panic attack, even when he makes them (which is rare)",27
"They never seem to think this when the police arrive, with their guns, to end a terrible situation. ",27
"Hey thanks, I appreciate it!",0
I love all weightloss shows but that one doesn’t interest me at all,18
This is what happens when you don't give the pyramid scheme a script.,27
"You will watch porn again, don't try to fool me",3
Defense takes more time to implement i think,6
"Disguising your feelings behind humor is not really a unique coping strategy, isn't it? ",6
Good. We don't want more thrash liberal offspring in this world.,4
Wtf Powerhouse Macomb is the gym I go to. I've never seen this dude there.,3
Oh look what you did! Now I have to go and get my cold cream gun.,3
someone should of grabbed [NAME] by his foot and use him as a club to bash [NAME]..,2
I think it says lanef instead of loner,27
We really need to stick to having helpful titles or a quick tldr.,27
Because a lot of people on this thread are ignoring the pirate code and I’m trying to explain that rules are there for a reason.,27

Bitch ass n*** [NAME] rooting for [NAME],2
It looks kind of like pen to me... Which would also make her skin so red.,27
"Pretty much does. SNP polling at 41% for the next election, CON at 25, LAB 23, LIB 6, and Greens at 3.",27
I don't think I'd like that either.,3
Do you mean artists?,7
In the USA you would've gotten that imaging faster.... *then* mortgage your house for that knee replacement,27
"So for you, consent and coercion are not mutually exclusive, correct? Are they ever?",4

I'd prefer her as an actual character,27
I totally missed this. What did [NAME] say ?,9

I'm concerned they actually have to press a button. Why no dead man's handle?,7
So people will support him in this fake news quick reaction political environment,3
It's also about anyone else who feels down or attacked by misandrist social signals. Finding ways to counteract these signals and their effects is a worthwhile pursuit.,4
